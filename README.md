Welcome to my github profile

My name is Alexandra and I am truly passionate multi-skilled specialist.
The thing I am really interested in now is Flutter mobile apps development with the use of Kotlin and XML to create a simple animation. I am a stickler for clarity and rules, that is why the more I learn strongly typed Dart, the more I respect Google.
