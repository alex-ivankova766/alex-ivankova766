My name is Alexandra and I am truly passionate multi-skilled specialist.

The thing I am really interested in now is <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71008947/174482202-c5acd0c3-9a5d-4415-bd64-f42347660f1a.png" width="15" height="15" />Flutter mobile apps development with the use of Kotlin and XML to create a simple animation. I am a stickler for clarity and rules, that is why the more I learn strongly typed Dart, the more I respect Google<img src="https://www.freepnglogos.com/uploads/google-logo-png/google-logo-png-webinar-optimizing-for-success-google-business-webinar-13.png" width="15" height="15"/>.

Dart is not my first programming language. It started back in 2005 when I had to device Qbasic tasks for myself because of getting ahead of school curriculum. Later at high-school I got acquainted with Pascal, HTML and Python. Math and programming Olympiad problems have always fascinated me. After school, I was work in art for many years. I have worked with the Sverdlovsk Film Studio, Boris Eifman Theater, KVN, Sima-Land and on individual orders. Then, in the 2022 I moved on to Telegram bot development and Django projects writing. When I realized I wanted to devote my life to programming I began interning with large companies to gain necessary experience. I seized the opportunity to learn how to create Kotlin Android apps in Siberian.pro, also I took part in writing server-side code on NestJS in Hotels.ru. In the spring of 2023, I became interested in Flutter. I completed 5 training courses at educative.io and started working on a commercial scientific project in the summer. Since then, the love for Dart and Flutter has only grown ðŸ©·
